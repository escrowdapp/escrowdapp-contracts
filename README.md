# about

This is an open source escrow dapp acts as a neutral third party between buyer and seller to protect both parties from potential fraudulent actions of the other.

We only get 1% fixed fee from processes. All gains will go for future product developments and marketing. We built this dapp for crypto advocates, for the public; not to make millions of dollars!

Feel free to ask any update, report bug and donate us to get bigger!
